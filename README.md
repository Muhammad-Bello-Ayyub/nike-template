# Nike Website Template

This is a template for a Nike-inspired website built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Description

This project was created to practice and demonstrate my skills in web development, particularly in the following areas:

- **Next.js:** I used Next.js as the foundation of this project, which allowed me to build a fast, server-rendered React application with ease.

- **Tailwind CSS:** I extensively utilized Tailwind CSS for styling. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that I found incredibly efficient and powerful for designing responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

- **Chakra UI:** In some parts of the project, I incorporated Chakra UI components to enhance the overall user experience.

- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring that the website looks great and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices was a top priority.

- **GitHub:** I used GitHub for version control and collaboration, which helped me manage the project efficiently.
